// Class 05: Data Types, like Int, Double, Float, and TypeOf

import Foundation

var a: Int = 6
var b: Double = 6.1
var c: Float = 6.1

/*
  the primitives data types follows the same structure independent of the language.
  so:
  Int -> its about a integer value, like 100, 1, -95, 4
  Double and Float are very simmilar, both storage numbers breakeds, the main difference is that
  Double is amazing most precise, what means that its size is bigger than Float
